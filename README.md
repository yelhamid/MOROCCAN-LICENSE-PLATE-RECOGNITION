<h1 <h1 align="center">MOROCCAN LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Moroccan License Plate Recognition project employs the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework to recognize and extract information from license plates in Morocco. The project is trained on a labeled dataset provided by UM6P, enhancing its accuracy and performance.</p>

  <h2>Project Objective</h2>
  <p>The primary goal is to develop an efficient license plate recognition system using YOLO, capable of accurately detecting and extracting license plate information from images. Leveraging the labeled dataset from UM6P, the model aims to achieve robust performance in various scenarios.</p>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <p>The project utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, a powerful and efficient framework for real-time object recognition. The training dataset is sourced from UM6P, providing labeled images of Moroccan license plates.</p>
